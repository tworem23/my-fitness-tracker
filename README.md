# My Fitness Tracker

This Node.js app demonstrates the simple back-end functionalities one can do using CRUD functions. This app is designed to help one keep track of their workouts. You are able to create, edit, and delete data from the API. I implemented an Oauth so that one can use this application with proper authorization for your data.
